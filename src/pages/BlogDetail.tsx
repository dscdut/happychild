        Signs and Symptoms of Autism Spectrum Disorder
      </div>
      <div className="mb-2">
        Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disability caused by
        differences in the brain. People with ASD often have problems with
        social communication and interaction, and restricted or repetitive
        behaviors or interests. People with ASD may also have different ways of
        learning, moving, or paying attention. It is important to note that some
        people without ASD might also have some of these symptoms. But for
        people with ASD, these characteristics can make life very challenging.
