          To have the most accurate assessment of child development
        </span>{' '}
        there needs to be collaboration between experts and the child’s family.
        At the same time, parents also need to closely follow their child
        throughout the testing process to provide support. When with people that
        the child is already very familiar with, the child will be less anxious
        and will perform according to their development.

        Preparing for the assessment and being a support person for your baby
        are the two most important things you can do to get accurate results.
        Here are some specific suggestions on what parents should do:
      </p>
      <ul className="ml-4 flex flex-col gap-2">
        <li>
          - Both parents should attend all meetings or screening tests if
          possible. You may have different information or ideas to contribute
          and you can compare notes to make sure you understand everything that
          is happening. If the baby’s father cannot attend, bring a friend or
          relative along for support.
        </li>
        <li>
          - Make sure your baby is healthy and comfortable during the
          assessment. For example, a frightened or ear-infected baby will not
          perform at their best.
        </li>
        <li>
          - A newly walking baby will be more comfortable with some preparation
          beforehand. Explain what will happen: Some doctors will ask your baby
          a few questions and observe your baby doing things they do every day,
          like playing with toys.
        </li>
        <li>
          - Prepare for all the questions that developmental experts may ask.
          You can research common questions beforehand, which can help you know
          what information you should have. Print out and complete those
          questions before the exam to make the most of that first assessment.
        </li>
        <li>
          - Make sure you receive a written report when the assessment is
          complete and ask questions about anything you don’t understand.
        </li>
        <li>
          - Get a second assessment before starting treatment - it can be
          expensive, time-consuming and emotionally draining for both you and
          your baby. Before committing to treatment, make sure you have an
          accurate diagnosis.
        </li>
        <li>
          - Have your baby reassessed periodically. Children grow and develop
          very quickly at different rates, so it’s important to assess
          regularly. Your baby may be delayed in multiple areas or have delays
          in different areas. Continuously monitor to catch changes as early as
          possible.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </>
