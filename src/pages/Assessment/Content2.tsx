        This can cause difficulties for children when they start school,
        socialize and live independently later on. According to US statistics,
        up to 17% of children aged 3-17 have one or more developmental and
        behavioral disabilities, such as autism spectrum disorder, intellectual
        disability (also known as intellectual developmental delay), learning
        difficulties, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In
        addition, many children have language development disorders as well as
        other areas.

        However, less than half of these children with developmental
        disabilities are detected before entering first grade
